## User Stories

How it Works:
Upon logging in, users are greeted with a concise
list of three delectable recipes, carefully selected to cater to
a variety of tastes and dietary preferences. With a countdown
timer of the 24-hour window, users have a limited time to peruse
and decide on their culinary adventures for the day.
